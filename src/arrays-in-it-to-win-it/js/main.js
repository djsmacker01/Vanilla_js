//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movie_list = ['Marlin', 'Rush Hour', '24 Hour'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movie_list[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let lengthArray = movie_list.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
