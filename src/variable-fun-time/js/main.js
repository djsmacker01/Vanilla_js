//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let num = 30

//minus 10 from that number
let minus = num - 10
//print that number to the console
console.log(minus)
//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input

//add 25 to that number

//alert that number

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
